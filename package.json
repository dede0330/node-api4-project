  "description": "In this challenge, you will build a simple Express app that is _deployable_ to Heroku. This means that it has a proper `start` script in the `package.json` file, and that the port number is taken from the environment instead of it being hard-coded. Feel free to deploy your app to Heroku, but bear in mind that this is not a free service anymore.",
